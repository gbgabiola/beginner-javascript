## Who this course is for:

- Absolute beginners to "I can get some stuff done but don't feel totally comfortable".
- This course is 100% beginner friendly. No JavaScript experience required. Basic HTML and CSS knowledge is assumed.
- If you feel like you have some holes in your skill set, could use a refresher or just want to pick up some new tips+tricks, I'd recommend still taking this course.
- The course is designed to be skip-able. Meaning that if you get the gist of the video, skip it! Onto the next one. We aren't building a large application in this one so there is no problem jumping around or ahead.
